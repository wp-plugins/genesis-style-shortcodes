Enables button, content box, and column shortcodes for Genesis child themes.

== Description ==

The Genesis Style Shortcodes plugin enables you to easily add button, content box, and column shortcodes to the posts 
and pages of your Genesis child theme. [View the demo.](http://twerdy.net/genesis-style-shortcodes)

This plugin utilizes shortcodes. In this case, they are an alternative to adding the styles via CSS, which many people 
are not comfortable touching (I will soon add a page on how to add these same styles using the CSS, which I highly 
recommend learning if you have the time).

**Credit**: The included column shortcodes are the same as used by the outstanding [Column Shortcodes for Genesis Child Themes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/column-shortcodes-for-genesis/) plugin by Cathy Tibbles.

**Available Shortcodes:**

*[gss-button url="#" target="_blank" color="gray"] Button Text [/gss-button]
Colors: gray, brown, black, blue, orange, green, red
Target: _blank, _self 

Content Boxes:

*[gss-content-box color="blue"]Content box text.[/gss-content-box]
Colors: blue, gray, green, purple, red and yellow.

Columns:

*[one-half first] and [one-half] 
*[one-third first] and [one-third] 
*[one-fourth first] and [one-fourth] 
*[one-fifth first] and [one-fifth] 
*[one-sixth first] and [one-sixth] 
*[end-column]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will you be adding more shortcodes? =

Yes, I also plan to add a TinyMCE addition to easily add the styles.

= What shortcodes will you be adding? =

Some on the drawing board are: Pull quotes, tabs and toggles.

= Why aren't my columns working? =

If you are not using a Genesis child theme, or are using an older release that does not include the necessary CSS the column 
shortcode will not work. However, you can [add the CSS yourself.](http://www.studiopress.com/tutorials/content-column-classes)
